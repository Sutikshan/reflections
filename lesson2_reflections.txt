We have following stages on which file lies :-

	working directory >> Staging Area >> Repository



$git add <file name>
$git add -A or $git add --all 
--will add edited/new files in working directory to staged area


$git commit <file name>
$git commit -a 
-- sends file from staging area to repository.

$git diff 
--compares working directory with saging area

$git diff --staged
-- compares staaging area against latest commit in repository

$git diff commit1 commit2
-- compares commit1 against commit2. What are the chagnes it will be required to make in commit1 to get commit2.


$git status
-- shows the difference in working director in red color. Shows the files lying in staging area (but not in repo) in green color.
